## What is Sonic?

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Wondering what Sonic is?** Check out **[valeriansaliou/sonic](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/sonic)**.

## How is it linked to Sonic?

`node-sonic-connector` maintains persistent TCP connections to the Sonic network interfaces that are listening on your running Sonic instance. In case `node-sonic-connector` gets disconnected from Sonic, it will retry to connect once the connection is established again.

You can configure the connection details of your Sonic instance when initializing `node-sonic-connector` from your code; via the Sonic host and port.
